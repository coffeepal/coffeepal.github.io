<h2>About</h2>

<p>
Hey, I'm the coffeepal! I'll take you with me onto my venture through personal projects and learnings!
Of course always with a cup of coffee!
</p>

<p>
I am an innovation engineer working fully remote. Besides coffee, I really like tech that simply works. <br/>
Furthermore I like to code, to learn new things and to enjoy the good things in life! <br/>
In this blog, I want to share my thoughts, my (sometimes creative) personal projects and my side hustle aspirations! <br/>
So if you are interested in tech, coffee and my two cents, grab a cup and stay tuned!
